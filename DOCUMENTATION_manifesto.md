# üìú LinguaForge Documentation Manifesto

> *"In the beginning was the Word? No. In the beginning was the Need to Communicate."*

This document outlines the philosophy that guides the creation and maintenance of documentation for the LinguaForge project.

## Our Guiding Principles

### 1. **Make the Invisible Visible**

Language is humanity's most powerful technology, yet we don't remember inventing it. Our primary goal is to make the invisible forces that shape language‚Äîcommunication pressure, efficiency, and social learning‚Äîvisible and interactive. The documentation must serve this goal by clearly explaining *what* is being simulated and *why* it matters.

### 2. **Accessibility for All**

Understanding should be accessible to everyone, not just specialists.

- **No Jargon without Explanation**: We will strive to use clear, plain language. When technical terms from linguistics, computer science, or cognitive science are necessary, they must be explained simply.
- **Multiple Levels of Depth**: The documentation should cater to a wide audience, from curious high school students to university researchers. Quick starts and high-level summaries should be available alongside deep dives into the scientific models.
- **Tool for Learning**: The simulation is an educational tool, and the documentation is its textbook. It should empower users to run their own experiments and answer their own questions.

### 3. **Bridge Disciplines**

The study of language evolution is inherently interdisciplinary. Our documentation must reflect this by connecting concepts across:

- **Linguistics**: Grammaticalization, syntax, phonology.
- **Cognitive Science**: Memory constraints, learning biases, theory of mind.
- **Evolutionary Biology**: Gene-culture coevolution, costly signaling.
- **Computer Science**: Multi-agent systems, emergent algorithms.

The documentation should act as a Rosetta Stone, helping someone from one field understand the concepts from another.

### 4. **Documentation as a Scientific Record**

LinguaForge is built upon decades of scientific research.

- **Cite Sources**: We must give credit to the foundational theories and models (e.g., Usage-Based Grammar, Iterated Learning, Naming Games). The documentation should provide a trail of references for those who wish to explore the primary literature.
- **Honesty about Abstractions**: Simulations are simplifications of reality. The documentation must be transparent about the model's assumptions, constraints, and limitations. It should clarify what is a direct implementation of a theory and what is a necessary abstraction.

### 5. **Foster a Community of Inquiry**

This project is not a static product; it is a living laboratory. The documentation should invite contribution and collaboration.

- **Empower Experimentation**: Provide clear guides on how to test hypotheses, replicate famous experiments, and design new scenarios.
- **Welcome Contributors**: Make the path to contributing clear, whether it's through code, linguistic validation, or creating educational materials.

> **Our Pledge:** We will document LinguaForge not as a finished answer, but as an interactive question. We will prioritize clarity over completeness, understanding over terminology, and inquiry over instruction. We believe that the best way to understand how language works is to watch one being built.

*Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by researchers who believe understanding should be accessible to all.*
